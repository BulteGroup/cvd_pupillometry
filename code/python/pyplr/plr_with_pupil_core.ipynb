    "# **Measuring the pupillary light reflex with a Pupil Core headset**\n",
    "This notebook explores some functionality of the Pupil Core system and shows how, in principle, we can use it to measure the pupil's light reflex and get accurate time-critical measures (e.g. latency to constrict, time-to-peak constriction) using the World Camera to detect light onset. To accomplish this we will need to make use of the Pupil Labs Network API, which uses ZeroMQ and MessagePack for fast and reliable communication. ZeroMQ (https://zeromq.org/) is an open source universal messaging library and MessagePack (https://msgpack.org/index.html) is a binary format for computer data interchange, like JSON but faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, make sure the tracker is plugged in and start the Pupil Capture real time application (download here: https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/). Now we can can import zmq and and set up the Pupil Remote helper, which uses ZeroMQs REQ-REP (request-reply) pattern for reliable one-to-one communication. Pupil Remote accepts requests via a REP socket, which by default is on port 50020 (use the --port application argument to provide a custom port)."

    "The Pupil Core system generates pupil data from eye camera images. It starts by fitting an ellipse to the pupil image and then calculating the diameter of the ellipse in 2d pixel units.

In addition to the pupil **topic** and the **timestamp** (which get inherited from the eye image), the fields **norm_pos** and **confidence** are also added.

    "### **Annotations and notifications**\n",
    "To calculate time-critical measures of the pupil's light response (e.g. constriction latency, time-to-peak constriction) we will need a reliable indication in the pupil data of the time at which a light stimulus was actually administered. Pupil Labs has an **Annotation Capture** plugin that can help us with this. The plugin allows timestamps to be marked with a label, which is basically the same as sending 'messages' or 'triggers'. The labels can be created by pressing customised hotkeys in Pupil Capture or they can be created programmatically and sent to Pupil Capture via the Pupil Core Network API. If our light stimulus could be controlled programmatically and with good timing then we would be able mark the onset and offset of the light within the Pupil recording just by sending an annotation immediately before or after we issue a command to change the status of the light. To do this, we need to start the Annotation Capture plugin, either by clicking on it in Pupil Capture, or by sending a **notification**. Notifications are special messages that Pupil uses to coordinate activities. They are key-value mappings with a required 'subject' field:\n",

    "### **Using the World Camera to detect light onset**\n",
    "The process outlined above looks to be reliable and efficient but it assumes no latency on the part of the actual event (e.g. a pulse of light). In our case, we can use the STLAB in asynchronous mode (i.e. with a video file) to precisely control the *duration* of a light stimulus, but we know that the command to start playing the video file will take some time to process. Usually this ranges between 100-200 ms, but it can sometimes be as high as 5 s due to various factors such as hardware, processes, whatever the LIGHT HUB is doing at the time, etc. This means that it will not suffice to simply send an annotation before /after we call `stlab.Device.play_video_file()` as the timestamp will not be a reliable indication of light onset. Pupil constriction latencies are typically on the order of around 200-250 ms, so we will need an efficient means of time-stamping stimulus onset. One possibility is to use the WorldCam to detect the onset of the light stimulus and its associated timestamp. For this, we'll need to use the **Frame Publisher** plugin. "

    "The `detect_light_onset()` function will basically grab frames from the world camera (e.g. numpy arrays with shape [1280, 720, 3], depending on resolution) calculate the mean, compare it to the mean of the previous frame, and then send a timestamped message using the timestamp associated with the first frame where the difference exceeds threshold.  For this to work, **Auto Exposure Mode** for Video source in Pupil Capture must be set to **manual mode**. Let's try it out. Make sure the lighting in the room is constant and have a light source at hand (e.g. smart phone torch, light switch). It might be necessary to adjust the threshold to suit the environment / camera settings. Also, for this application, as we are only detecting a change in brightness we can use a lower resolution and take advantage of the faster frame rate that this allows (e.g. set resolution to [640, 480] and frame rate to 120).

Play back the video, and hopefully the LIGHT_ON annotation is stamped on the screen where the light appeared. Assuming 8.5 ms camera latency and >3 ms processing latency (as reported in the Pupil Core tech specs), this means that in theory we have timestamped the event to within 11 ms (plus up to another 1/fps). It may take some optimisation, but this principle can be used to detect the onset of a light stimulus administered by the STLAB. "
