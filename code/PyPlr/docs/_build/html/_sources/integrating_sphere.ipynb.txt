    "For basic experiments it may be sufficient to use a standard computer monitor to administer stimuli, but where research calls for advanced control over the geometry of retinal stimulation, a bespoke setup is required. One solution would be to use a Maxwellian view pupillometry system, where the light stimulus is focused onto an aperture placed in front of the eye, or in the entrance plane of a pharmacologically dilated pupil, and the consensual pupil response is measured from the other eye. An alternative, which does not require complex optical engineering, pharmacological dilation of the pupil, or strict fxation control on the part of the observer, is to use a full-field, or ‘Ganzfeld’, illumination system. \n",

    "We constructed one from two 45-cm diameter flanged acrylic half-domes acryllic half domes, each coated on the inside with [Avian-B white reflectance coating](https://aviantechnologies.com/product/avian-b-white-reflectance-coating/), to scatter light homogenously. A 28 cm opening in one of the domes serves as a viewing port and an additional 7 cm (subtending ~9 degrees from the plane of the viewing port) opening opposite the viewing port was included to allow for secondary stimuli (e.g., a fixation target) or to afford exclusion of the foveal macular pigment from stimulation. On the same half of the sphere as the viewing port, a 30 mm entry port for the light source was cut at an angle of 22.5-deg from the top, such that it could not be seen directly when looking straight ahead. The sphere was housed on a stabilised wooden fixing plate. \n",
