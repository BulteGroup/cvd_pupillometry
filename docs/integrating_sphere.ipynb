    "For some experiments it may be sufficient to use a standard computer monitor to administer stimuli, but where research calls for advanced control over the geometry of retinal stimulation, a bespoke setup is required. One solution is to use a Maxwellian view pupillometry system, where a light stimulus is focused onto an aperture positioned in front of the eye, or in the entrance plane of a pharmacologically dilated pupil, and the consensual pupil response is measured from the other eye. But this approach requires some fairly complicated optical engineering and resources that may not be available in the average research setting. As an alternative, we developed a low-cost integrating sphere that provides a full-field, 'Ganzfeld', stimulus and precludes the need for optical engineering, pharmacological dilation of the pupil, or strict fixation control on the part of the participant."

    "We built our sphere from two 45 cm diameter flanged acrylic half-domes ([Project Plastics Ltd](https://www.projectplastics.co.uk/)), each coated on the inside with [Avian-B white reflectance coating](https://aviantechnologies.com/product/avian-b-white-reflectance-coating/) to scatter light homogenously. A 28 cm opening in one of the domes serves as a viewing port and an additional 7 cm (subtending ~9 degrees from the plane of the viewing port) opening opposite the viewing port was included to allow for secondary stimuli (e.g., a fixation target) or to allow for exclusion of the foveal macular pigment from stimulation. On the same half of the sphere as the viewing port, a 30 mm entry port for the light source was cut at an angle of 22.5 deg from the top, such that it could not be seen directly when looking straight ahead. The sphere was housed on a stabilised wooden fixing plate. \n",
