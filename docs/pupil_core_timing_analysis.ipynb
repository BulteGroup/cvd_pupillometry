    "`PupilCore().light_stamper(...)` timestamps light stimuli with the timestamp associated with the first frame where a ligh becomes visible to the world camera. The Pupil software synchronises the data streams from the cameras, but what do we know? The Pupil Core eye tracker synchronises the clocks of thre cameras, but this is not perfect. This analysis explores the reliabilty of the timing and the implications.\n",
